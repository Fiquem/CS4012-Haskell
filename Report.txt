Solver
------
The solver only has 3 moves, which I'll list in order of priority:

	1. Flag obvious mine
		If there is a numbered tile on the board surrounded by an 
		amount of concealed tiles equal to that number, flag those 
		tiles.

	2. Play an unambiguously safe move - the simple version
		If there is a numbered tile on the board surrounded by an 
		amount of flagged tiles equal to that number, reveal all 
		concealed tiles surrounding that numbered tile.
		This method does not tke into account the 1-2-1 or 1-2-2-1 
		patterns mentioned on the Minesweeper wiki 'cause man, 
		fuck that shit. Searching the adjacent tiles of one tile was 
		hard enough.

	3. Reveal the next available concealed tile
		If there are no obvious mines to flag or obvious safe tiles 
		to reveal, reveal the first concealed tile on the board.
